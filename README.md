## Getting Started

First, pull the environment varaibles with:

```bash
vercel pull
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
vercel dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

** sometimes you'll still have to use yarn dev because it uses faust dev **
