# Script Rendering Fix - Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Testing

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Test pages with Mautic forms render correctly
- [ ] Test pages with multiple Mautic forms on same page
- [ ] Test pages with generic scripts (analytics, tracking, etc.)
- [ ] Test pages with no scripts at all
- [ ] Test form submissions work correctly
- [ ] Test form validation and error handling

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Verify no console errors on pages with forms
- [ ] Check that form styling is preserved
- [ ] Confirm form tracking/analytics still fire
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- [ ] Test with different WordPress content types

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Verify no performance degradation
- [ ] Check that scripts don't load multiple times
- [ ] Confirm proper cleanup on component unmount
- [ ] Test memory usage with multiple forms

## Code Review Checklist

- [x] No hardcoded dependencies in BlockHtml
- [x] Registry pattern implemented correctly
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] No breaking changes to existing components
- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [x] No ESLint errors or warnings

## Documentation Review

- [x] `script_rendering_fix.md` - Comprehensive technical documentation
- [x] `adding-script-handlers-example.md` - Practical examples for developers
- [x] `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference guide
- [x] `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This checklist

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
yarn install

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Run type checking (if applicable)
yarn type-check

# Build the project
yarn build
```

### 2. Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
vercel deploy --env=staging

# Test on staging environment
# (Run through functional testing checklist)

# Deploy to production
vercel deploy --prod
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### Immediate (First Hour)
- [ ] Monitor error logs for any script-related errors
- [ ] Check New Relic for performance anomalies
- [ ] Verify forms are loading on production
- [ ] Test form submissions on production

#### Short-term (First Day)
- [ ] Monitor form submission rates (should be consistent)
- [ ] Check analytics for any drop in form interactions
- [ ] Review user feedback/support tickets
- [ ] Monitor server logs for any new errors

#### Long-term (First Week)
- [ ] Compare form conversion rates to baseline
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Gather team feedback on maintainability
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

### Quick Rollback (Emergency)
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback
```

### Manual Rollback (If needed)
1. Revert the following files:
   - `src/components/blocks/core/BlockHtml/BlockHtml.js`
   - `src/lib/scriptComponentRegistry.js` (delete)
2. Restore hardcoded MauticForm import in BlockHtml
3. Redeploy

### Rollback Triggers
- Forms not rendering on production
- Significant increase in JavaScript errors
- Form submission rate drops >10%
- Critical user-facing bugs

## Communication Plan

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Notify team of upcoming deployment
- [ ] Share documentation links
- [ ] Brief QA team on testing focus areas

### During Deployment
- [ ] Post deployment status in team channel
- [ ] Share staging URL for testing
- [ ] Coordinate with QA for production testing

### After Deployment
- [ ] Announce successful deployment
- [ ] Share monitoring dashboard links
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Schedule retrospective if needed

## Success Criteria

✅ All Mautic forms render correctly
✅ No increase in JavaScript errors
✅ Form submission rates remain stable
✅ No performance degradation
✅ Team can easily add new script handlers
✅ Documentation is clear and helpful

## Known Limitations

- Registry only supports synchronous handler detection
- No priority system for overlapping patterns
- Handlers must be registered at build time (not runtime)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more script handlers (HubSpot, Formstack, etc.)
2. Implement handler priority system
3. Add async handler loading for code splitting
4. Create admin UI for managing handlers
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
